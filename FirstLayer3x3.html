          <p>Making the cross on a Rubik's Cube is one of the first steps in solving the puzzle. 
            It involves arranging the edge pieces of one face so that they form a cross with the correct colors on the adjacent sides. 
            Here's a step-by-step guide to making the cross:</p>

            <br>

            <p>Choose a face: Select a face to begin with. Many solvers start with the white face, but you can choose any face you prefer.</p>
            
            <p>Look for edge pieces: Identify the edge pieces on the chosen face that have colors matching the center stickers of the adjacent sides. 
                                  For example, if you're working on the white face, look for edge pieces with white and another 
                                  color that matches the center stickers of the adjacent sides.</p>
            
            <p>Position the first edge: Locate the first edge you want to fill and move it to the right place.
                                    (This can be done with or without algorithms).</p>
            
            <p>Repeat for the remaining edges: Continue the process of locating edge pieces with matching colors and positioning them 
                                            correctly until you have a cross on the chosen face. 
                                            It may take several moves or algorithms to achieve this, but with practice, you'll become more efficient.</p>

        <p>The top layer also can be made without algorithms. The goal is to fill the corners in the cube. To make this happen you need to locate the four corners and move them to the egdes you need to fill.Through practice and repating the methods you make make the process faster.</p>
