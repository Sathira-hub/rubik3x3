            A 3x3 Rubik's Cube consists of six sides, each made up of nine smaller squares or "cubies." 
            The sides of a Rubik's Cube are typically referred to by their color: white, yellow, green, blue, red, and orange.
            Let's describe each side in more detail:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>White Side: The white side is opposite the yellow side. It consists of nine white cubies. Each cubie has a white sticker on the visible face.</li>
                <li>Yellow Side: The yellow side is opposite the white side. It also consists of nine yellow cubies, with each cubie having a yellow sticker on the visible face.</li>            
                <li>Green Side: The green side is opposite the blue side. It consists of nine green cubies, with each cubie having a green sticker on the visible face.</li>
                <li>Blue Side: The blue side is opposite the green side. It consists of nine blue cubies, with each cubie having a blue sticker on the visible face.</li>
                <li>Red Side: The red side is opposite the orange side. It consists of nine red cubies, with each cubie having a red sticker on the visible face.</li>
                <li>Orange Side: The orange side is opposite the red side. It consists of nine orange cubies, with each cubie having an orange sticker on the visible face.</li>
            </ul>

            
        <p>    
            Each side can be turned independently, rotating either clockwise or counterclockwise, allowing for various combinations and permutations of the colored cubies. 
            The goal is to solve the Rubik's Cube by aligning all the cubies so that each side is a solid color.

        <p>When you hold the cube,</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>the side facing to you is called <b>Front</b>.</li>
            <li>the side on your left is called <b>Left</b>.</li>
            <li>the side on your right is called <b> Right</b>.</li>
            <li>the opposite side to the Front is called <B>Back</B></li>
            <li>the top of the cube is called <b>Up</b>.</li>
            <li>the bottom side of the cube is called <b>Down</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each side is called in diffecent name to understand the methods clearly and easily.</p>
