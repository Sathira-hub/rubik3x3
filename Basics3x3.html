        <h1><b><u>Basic Moves</u></b></h1>

        <p>To solve the cube you need to understand the basic moves to rotate the cube.
          The cube and be rotated either clockwise or counter clockwise. Each side of the cube can be rotated with these two ways.
          When writing these moves each side is named with the names given in the previous table in the introduction section. 
          </p><br><p>We write just the side to trun it counter clockwise.

        </p>
        <p>ex: 'F' is used when the Front side is turned clockwise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To turn counter clockwise, the side name is written with the symbol ' .</p>
        
        <p>ex:  F' is used when the Front side is turend counter clockwise</p>
        <br>
        <p>The rest of the moves are displayed below.</p>

R: Rotate the right face clockwise 90 degrees.
R': Rotate the right face counterclockwise 90 degrees.
R2: Rotate the right face 180 degrees (half turn).

r: Rotate the wide right face (both the right face and the middle slice) clockwise 90 degrees.
r': Rotate the wide right face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

x: Rotate the entire cube along the x-axis (from left to right) as if performing an R move, 
   but also rotating the other layers accordingly.

y: Rotate the entire cube along the y-axis (from bottom to top) as if performing a U move, 
   but also rotating the other layers accordingly.

U: Rotate the upper face clockwise 90 degrees.
U': Rotate the upper face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

u: Rotate the wide upper face (both the upper face and the middle slice) clockwise 90 degrees.
u': Rotate the wide upper face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

z: Rotate the entire cube along the z-axis (from front to back) as if performing an F move, 
   but also rotating the other layers accordingly.

M: Rotate the middle slice clockwise 90 degrees.
F: Rotate the front face clockwise 90 degrees.
F': Rotate the front face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

B: Rotate the back face clockwise 90 degrees.
B': Rotate the back face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

D: Rotate the lower face clockwise 90 degrees.
D': Rotate the lower face counterclockwise 90 degrees.

L: Rotate the left face clockwise 90 degrees.
L': Rotate the left face counterclockwise 90 degrees.
